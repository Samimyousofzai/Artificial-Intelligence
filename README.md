Artifical-Intelligence Practicals
Write a prolog program to calculate the sum of two numbers.
Write a Prolog program to implement max(X, Y, M) so that M is the maximum of two numbers X and Y.
Write a program in PROLOG to implement factorial (N, F) where F represents the factorial of a number N.
Write a program in PROLOG to implement generate_fib(N,T) where T represents the Nth term of the fibonacci series.
Write a Prolog program to implement GCD of two numbers.
Write a Prolog program to implement power (Num,Pow, Ans) : where Num is raised to the power Pow to get Ans.
Prolog program to implement multi (N1, N2, R) : where N1 and N2 denotes the numbers to be multiplied and R represents the result.
Write a Prolog program to implement memb(X, L): to check whether X is a member of L or not.
Write a Prolog program to implement conc (L1, L2, L3) where L2 is the list to be appended with L1 to get the resulted list L3.

Write a Prolog program to implement sumlist(L, S) so that S is the sum of a given list L.
Write a Prolog program to implement two predicates evenlength(List) and oddlength(List) so that they are true if their argument is a list of even or odd length respectively.

Write a prolog program to implement insert_nth (I, N, L, R) that inserts an item I into Nth position of list L to generate a list R.
Write a Prolog program to implement delete_nth (N, L, R) that removes the element on Nth position from a list L to generate a list R.
